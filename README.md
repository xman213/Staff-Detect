# Staff-Detect


This tool allows you to know if someone has remoted into your computer. 
It was coded in python and was private but I have made it free and open src. Please do not use this at your school and it is not a good idea to. do so you will get in trouble

# How to install

For users that are good with python, Look in the src and download the requrements ur self. For people that dont want to do that, just use the exe


# Use

You are free to modify but please just give a little credit. Dont go and say you made it yourself.
