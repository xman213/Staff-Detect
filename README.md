# Staff-Detect


This tool allows you to know if someone has remoted into your computer. 
It was coded in python and was private but I have made it free and open src. Please do not use this at your school and it is not a good idea to. do so you will get in trouble

For all old users the auth servers are down so please use the new one with no hwid leak!
